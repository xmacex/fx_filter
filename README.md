# Filter fx for norns

A simple implementation of [DFM1](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/DFM1.html) SuperCollider filter as a norns effect. Requires sixolet's amazing fx framework.

> DFM1 is a digitally modelled analog filter.1 It provides low-pass and high-pass filtering. The filter can be overdriven and will self-oscillate at high resonances.

The norns fx caps resonance and gain for safety reasons.
